<h2 align="left">About me</h2>
<p align="left">
I approach development with a strong focus on problem-solving, clear thinking, and understanding the broader context of a system rather than just individual features. I enjoy breaking down complex problems and working through them in a structured and thoughtful way.
<br><br>
I value collaboration and clear communication, and I’m comfortable working in team-based environments where ideas are shared, discussed, and refined. I believe good software is built through teamwork, continuous learning, and attention to long-term maintainability.
